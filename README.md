# Belwerks | Styles

Simple utility styles to get up and running quickly and consistently.

## Install

```
npm i belwerks-styles
```

## Use (JSX)

You can grab the entire styles library by importing the package like you would any other CSS module:

```jsx
import 'belwerks-styles';
```

Or you can grab one or more separate stylesheets, if you don't want the whole thing:

```jsx
import 'belwerks-styles/layout.css';
import 'belwerks-styles/utilities.css';
```

Stylesheets aren't cross-dependant, so you won't run into errors from only grabbing the one(s) you want.
